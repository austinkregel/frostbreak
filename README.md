# WinterCMS & OctoberCMS Marketplace (Open Source)

Welcome to the open source Marketplace project! This application aims to provide a modern, community-driven marketplace for the WinterCMS and OctoberCMS ecosystems, with a primary focus on WinterCMS compatibility.

## Project Goals
- **Open Source First:** Built for and by the community. We welcome contributions, feedback, and ideas from everyone.
- **Marketplace for CMS Ecosystems:** Serve as a central hub for discovering, searching, installing, and updating plugins and themes for WinterCMS (and, in the future, OctoberCMS).
- **Project Linking:** Easily link your projects to the marketplace for streamlined management.
- **Plugin & Theme Management:** Search, install, and update plugins and themes directly from the marketplace interface.
- **Core Updates:** Experimental support for updating the core WinterCMS version (currently under investigation; use with caution).

## Current Status
- Project linking, plugin/theme search, installation, and updates are supported for WinterCMS.
- Core updates are technically possible, but require further investigation before being recommended for production use.
- OctoberCMS support is planned for the future.
